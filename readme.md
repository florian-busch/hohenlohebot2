HohenloheBot 2.0
Twitter bot that interacts with tweets about Hohenlohe, a region in southern Germany.

Functionality:
  1. Retweets every tweet that contains keywords such as 'hohenlohe', 'hohenlohisch' (the regional dialect) etc. Has some basic filter function to exclude tweets that contain keywords but have nothing to do with Hohenlohe as a region.
  2. Posts tweets with words from the regional dialect Hohenlohisch and proverbs or just funny things people say

Runs on twit (https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit) with a mongodb database.

This is the rework with better folder and file organization.

Input and optimizations very welcome.
